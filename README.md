# FUTURE USE OF WEB PROGRAMMING
While working an awful retail job this summer I came across the following scheduling issues:

You put a post-it note when you needed a day off… Which many times the HR department would forget to give you the day.

You put up a post-it note if you need to switch shifts, then physically walk around the store asking every single employee in your department if they can take a look at the post-it you placed up.

The HR department would print out a single copy of the schedule and place a physical copy on the board. You needed to call in or physically enter the building just to see your weekly schedule. 

The HR department used a poorly designed “random generator” for the schedules which did not account for days off, did not account for making sure each week was similar shifts (example: Working a closing shift then an opening shift the following day, resulting in little sleep). 

I was so appalled by the scheduling used at the Target I was employed by, I decided it would be a good project to design a website/web app that fixed all these issues and more! As we continue through this semester I hope to accomplish:

Each store makes an account and sets up their departments.

The employees in each department make accounts and input their own availabilities/times that they can work.

If an employee needs a day off it will automatically send out a notification to all employees in their department asking if someone will cover their shift. They can agree with a simple click of a button.

The schedule generator will be on a weekly basis so nobody will have conflicting schedules with terrible times every other day.

The schedule generator will make sure the specified number of employees is working to suit the manager of the department’s needs. If this need every changes or they do not have enough employees to consistently fill all the required shifts, it will alert the manager that more hires are needed. As well as message them any issues with the schedule that it could not fix. This way the manager and HR department can have a piece of mind and will only be alerted of serious issues. They won’t have to spend tons of manpower each week fixing and re-adjusting schedules.
